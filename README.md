# Pinball-Game
this game is different idea
because you can play  it using external buttons instead of keyboard buttons , 
was developed using TCP connection (C#) to receive message from ( buttons which connected to ARDUINO )
over WIFI Bluetooth also connected with ARDUINO and finally all of this to move the flippers UP and Down.
